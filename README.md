## Project Description
This is a catalogue for the toys and games domain. Currently, users can:
- View the catalogue: displays the product ID, name, amount in stock, price, genre, rating, manufacturer, UPC, and description.
- Add to the catalogue: allows the user to input a new product using the same parameters as view (product ID, name, stock, price, genre, rating, manufacturer, UPC, and description).
- Edit the catalogue: allows the user to change product parameters such as product ID, name, stock, and price.
- Delete from the catalogue: removes a product based on an inputted product ID.
